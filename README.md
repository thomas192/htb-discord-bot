# Hack The Box Discord Bot

A Discord bot that sends messages when members flag a box or a challenge (actives only).

## Usage

First thing to do when setting up the bot is to initialize it on the designated channel with ``!init``. By default, the channel's name must be ``pwned``.

Users can bind their HTB id with ``!bind <id>`` and unbind with ``!purge``.
